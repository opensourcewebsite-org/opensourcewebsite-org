## Telegram Bot

The bot deletes previous messages in private chat that are not related to the current request. In this case, the `editMessageTextOrSendMessage` command is used to display the message. If you need to send several messages (for example, display a text message "Your geolocation", then send a message with a geolocation, and then a message with a keyboard for editing or return), then you must first call the editMessageTextOrSendMessage command, and then sendLocation and sendMessage.

## Core

- `FLOAT`
  - Working with `float` in PHP always use [BC Math Functions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.bc.php).
    - For handy comparison of two floats use `\app\helpers\Number`. [Why it so important?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3148937/compare-floats-in-php)
    - If DB table has decimal column - add trait `\app\models\traits\FloatAttributeTrait` into `ActiveRecord`.
    - Beware the same problem in all program languages ([MySql](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2188139/check-for-equality-on-a-mysql-float-field), [JS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3343623/javascript-comparing-two-float-values/3343658), etc.)
