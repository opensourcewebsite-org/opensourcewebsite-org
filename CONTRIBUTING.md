### Key branches

- `master` is the latest, deployed version

## Contribute to the core code or bug fixes

### Your First Code Contribution

Start by looking through these issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/opensourcewebsite-org/opensourcewebsite-org/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+sort%3Acomments-desc) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two. Issues are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.
- TODO issues - find comments with keyword `TODO` in the source code, with a description of a issue, and suggestions to resolve it.

## Contribute/translate to documentations or messages

You can help improve documentations/translations by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos.

Please read how [Internationalization (I18N)](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/tutorial-i18n) works.

[All translations](https://github.com/opensourcewebsite-org/opensourcewebsite-org/tree/master/messages) are in source files.

To do so, make changes to source files. Then open a pull request to apply your changes to `master` branch.

To help our CI servers you should add `[ci skip]` to your documentation commit message to skip build on that commit. Please remember to use it for commits containing only documentation changes.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Include an issue number to the beginning of the first line (if applicable)

Example `#234 YOUR_COMMIT_NAME`

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- In case changing only texts or documentations include `[ci skip]` to the end of the first line
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

#### Yii 2 migration files

https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/2.0/yii-db-migration

Before to create a migration files use [wwwsqldesigner](https://github.com/ondras/wwwsqldesigner) to prototype your changes for the database. For example you can use https://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/?keyword=default with any keyword and share the link with other contributors.

##### safeUp()

https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/2.0/yii-db-migration#safeUp()-detail

- Name database tables in the singular to list any objects. For example, `user`, but not` users`.
- Do not use variables like `$tableName` and `$tableOptions`.
- Do not use database comments for the database and columns.

Columns:
- Primary key with integer - use `$this->primaryKey()->unsigned()`.
- Integer values between 0-255 - use `$this->tinyInteger()->unsigned()`.
- Integer values between 0-65535 - use `$this->smallInteger()->unsigned()`.
- Integer values above 65535 - use `$this->integer()->unsigned()`.
- Datetime or timeshtamp values - use `$this->integer()->unsigned()`.
- Do not specify a length for columns with integer values.
- Floating-point values where precision is needed, such as money or coordinates - use `$this->decimal($precision, $scale)->unsigned()`. Avoid using float columns without explicit necessity, as this type is not exact.

##### safeDown()

https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/2.0/yii-db-migration#safeDown()-detail

Use only for deletion of objects of the database structure (tables, fields, keys, indexes).
If you create new migration, it's necessary to check weather it could be successfully rolled back and applied again.

##### Upgrade data in the database

To upgrade data in the database, create a migration whose name starts with `upgrade_`. Use data access only through DAO (yii\db\Command), not through the models. These migrations are required for existing databases.

### JavaScript Style Guide

JavaScript Code MUST adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com).

Recommended IDE:
  - [Atom](https://atom.io)
  - [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
  - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org)
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)

- Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
- Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible

```javascript
  // Use this:
  export default class ClassName {

  }

  // Instead of:
  class ClassName {

  }
  export default ClassName
```

### Composer

https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md

In all cases when `composer.json` file is updated, add ` composer.json` and `composer.lock` files to the same commit.

Each package must contain specific version. Don't use `*` and `@dev` versions.
