# Installation

## General setup

## Fixtures

Fixtures are used to load a "fake" set of data into a database that can then be used for testing or to help give you some interesting data while you're developing your application.

After loading fixtures, will be available this [user login credentials](tests/fixtures/data/user.php).

Attention! When loading fixtures, all current records from the database will be deleted!

Loading fixtures:
```
php yii fixture/load "*"
```

Unloading fixtures:
```
php yii fixture/unload "*"
```

## Telegram bots

We recommend use [ngrok - secure introspectable tunnels to localhost](https://ngrok.com), for local development and testing of Telegram bots. Telegram webhooks require your URL to be public and secure (HTTPS). ngrok is a tool that exposes your local environment to the world.

- Use [Telegram BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to create new bot and get a bot token.
- Set `baseUrl` in `params.php` for your ngrok https url.
- In case of connection problems to Telegram, use free anonymous proxy ([list 1](https://www.firexproxy.com/en), [list 2](https://mtpro.xyz/socks5)) to set `telegramProxy` in `params.php`.
- Create a new record in `bot` table in MySQL database, with `status` = 0, or use console command to add new bot:
```
php yii bot/add TOKEN
```

Enable Telegram webhooks for all bots with `status` = 0:
```
php yii bot/enable-all
```

Disable Telegram webhooks for all bots with `status` = 1:
```
php yii bot/disable-all
```
