<h4>How We Use your Information</h4>

<p>
OSW may use non-personal data that is aggregated for reporting about the Website usability, performance, and effectiveness. It may be used to improve the experience, usability, and content of the Website.
</p>

<p>
OSW may use personal information to provide services that support the activities of the OSW’s members and their collaboration on the OSW’s standards and projects. When accessing the OSW’s members-only web pages, your personal user information may be tracked by OSW in order to support collaboration, ensure authorized access, and enable communication between members.
</p>

<p>
Credit card information may be collected to facilitate membership applications; or if you purchase a product or service from this Website, such information will not be kept longer than necessary for providing the services requested. Credit card numbers are used only for processing payment and are not used for other purposes. Payment processing services may be provided by a third-party payment service, and a management company external to OSW may provide support for the financial activities of OSW. OSW may share your personal information with its partners to facilitate these transactions.
</p>

<h4>Information Sharing</h4>

<p>
OSW does not sell, rent, or lease any individual’s personal information or lists of email addresses to anyone for marketing purposes, and we take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of this information. However, OSW reserve the right to supply any such information to any organization into which OSW may merge in the future or to which it may make any transfer in order to enable a third party to continue part or all of its mission. We also reserve the right to release personal information to protect our systems or business, when we reasonably believe you to be in violation of our Terms of Use or if we reasonably believe you to have initiated or participated in any illegal activity. In addition, please be aware that in certain circumstances, OSW may be obligated to release your personal information pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or other orders.
</p>

<p>
In keeping with our open process, OSW may maintain publicly accessible archives for the majority of our activities. For example, posting an email to any of OSW’s-hosted public mail lists or discussion forums, subscribing to one of our newsletters or registering for one of our public meetings may result in your email address becoming part of the publicly accessible archives.
</p>

<p>
On some sites, anonymous users are allowed to post content and/or participate in forum discussions. In such a case, since no user name can be associated with such a user, the IP address number of a user is used as an identifier. When posting content or messages to the Website anonymously, your IP address may be revealed to the public.
</p>

<p>
If you are a registered member of this Website, you should be aware that some items of your personal information may be visible to other members and to the public. OSW’s member databases may retain information about your name, e-mail address, company affiliation (if an organizational member), and such other personal address and identifying data as you choose to supply. That data may be visible to other of OSW’s members and to the public. Your name, e-mail address, and other information you may supply also may be associated in OSW’s publicly accessible records with OSW’s various committees, working groups, and similar activities that you join, in various places, including: (i) the permanently-posted attendance and membership records of those activities; (ii) documents generated by the activity, which may be permanently archived; and, (iii) along with message content, in the permanent archives of OSW’s e-mail lists, which also may be public.
</p>

<p>
Please remember that any information (including personal information) that you disclose in public areas of this Website, such as forums, message boards, and news groups, becomes public information that others may collect, circulate, and use. Because we cannot and do not control the acts of others, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose information about yourself or others in public forums such as these.
</p>

<p>
Given the international scope of the Website, personal information may be visible to persons outside your country of residence, including to persons in countries that your own country’s privacy laws and regulations deem deficient in ensuring an adequate level of protection for such information. If you are unsure whether this Privacy Policy is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should not submit your information. If you are located within the European Union, you should note that your information will be transferred to the United States, which is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection. Nevertheless, in accordance with local laws implementing European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 (“EU Privacy Directive”) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, individuals located in countries outside of the United States of America who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to its transfer to and/or storage in the United States of America.
</p>

<p>
If you do not want your personal information collected and used by OSW, please do not visit the Website or apply for membership of the Website or email lists.
</p>

<p>
OSW are committed to keeping the personal information of our members accurate. All the information you have submitted to us can be verified and changed. In order to do this, please email us a request. We may provide members with online access to their own personal profiles, enabling them to update or delete information at any time. To protect our members’ privacy and security, we also may take reasonable steps to verify identity, such as a user ID and password, before granting access to modify personal profile data. Certain areas of the Website may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords or other personal identifiers; a password prompt is your indication that a members-only resource is being accessed.
</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>
OSW make every effort to protect personal information by users of the Website, including using firewalls and other security measures on its servers. No server, however, is 100% secure, and you should take this into account when submitting personal or confidential information about yourself on any web site, including this one. Much of the personal information is used in conjunction with member services such as collaboration and discussion, so some types of personal information such as your name, company affiliation, and email address will be visible to other OSW’s members and to the public. OSW assume no liability for the interception, alteration, or misuse of the information you provide. You alone are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please use care when use access this Website and provide personal information.
