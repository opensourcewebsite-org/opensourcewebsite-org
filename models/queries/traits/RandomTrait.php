     * <b>NOTE:</b>
     * 1. all Query::$params must be set BEFORE this method
     * 2. If you will add any condition AFTER this method - query may find 0 rows with some chance.
     *
     * So call this method right before querying.
     *
     * * <b>Description:</b> This method uses ORDER BY RAND(), but only on a small percentage of the table rows; this percentage is based upon how many rows you want, LIMIT 1, divided by how many rows the table has, COUNT(*), and then multiply that figure by 10 to avoid returning less rows than you request.
     * * <b>Advantage:</b> Easy to use in complicated SQL queries and you don’t need to have a sequentially numbered field in your table. Easily select multiple random rows by simply increasing the LIMIT and adjusting the WHERE statement to match.
     * * <b>Disadvantage:</b> This method’s speed is directly related to how long it takes to generate a random value for each row you query. The more random rows you want, the longer it takes.
